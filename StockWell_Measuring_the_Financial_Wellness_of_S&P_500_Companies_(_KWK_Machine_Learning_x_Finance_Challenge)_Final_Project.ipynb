        "Investors, students, and the public often struggle to understand if a company is financially \"healthy\" or stable from raw stock data. Traditional financial indicators can be confusing or inaccessible, and existing scoring systems are proprietary or not accessible to the public.\n",

        "## Results\n",
        "The Random Forest Model showed that it can predict the Financial Health Score (FHS). When I looked at the features, Market Capitalization is the strongest predictor of the future finacial health of a company shorterm. Compared to Current Price, EBITDA, and Revenue Growth. This shows that company size plays a major role in predicting short-term financial performance and the next Financial Health Score. The Model's Errors (MAE aroung 0.88 - 0.92) showed me that the predictions where close to the real values. The model was consistent and gave me insight on which financial factors matter the most.\n",
        "\n",
        "-----------------\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
        "This project showed me that machine learning can be used to estimate a company's short-term financial future by using financial indicators like EBITDA, revenue growth, market cap and stock price. Creating the FHS, I took inspiration from the Altman Z-Score, to meausre finacial stability of companies. My simplified version follows the same idea by standarizing metrics and summing them to capture profitability, growth, valuation and size in one score.\n",
        "\n",
        "After training the Random Forest Model, it showed me that a companies Market Cap is a strong indicator of a companies preformance.\n",
        "\n",
        "For future improvements I would like to add more advanced models like the Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), since they work well with financial data (especially ones with a lot of outliers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project shows that machine learning can be applied to create a financial health score of a company that anyone can understand similarily to a credit score. Applying machine learning is helpful because it recoginzes patterns and is able to turn them into one score that can tell us if a company looks strong or risky. The main concept is to make financial analysis more accesible for people who want to learn about companies.\n",

Each metric was standardized using the Z-Score normalization to account for differences in scale, ensuring that a single metric won't dominate the score. The standardized values are then summed to produce the FHS:\n",
